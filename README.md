Code and documentation for Apa-Apo Dec 2018


Processing camin sketch was used for half of the performance in Dec. 2018. Then the syphon system failed, and the second half of the performance used the visuals directly from EOS utility, zoomed in on the controlling laptop. This method is more reliable but gives a worse resolution picture- this aesthetic, though, became something enjoyable. 

Until a better workflow for camera display is developed, this zoomed version of EOS utility is the best move for DSLR camera display.
