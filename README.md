Code and documentation for Apa-Apo Dec 2018

Refer to "2_APA_APO_dayof.pdf" document for most recent execution workflow. The "final workflow" document is an archived process workflow in my development of the project.

Processing camin sketch was used for the camera display for half of the performance in Dec. 2018. Then the syphon system (described in the previously listed dayof.pdf) failed, and the second half of the performance used the visuals directly from EOS utility, zoomed in on the controlling laptop. This method is more reliable but gives a worse resolution picture- this aesthetic, though, became something enjoyable. 

Until a better workflow for camera display is developed, this zoomed version of EOS utility is the best move for DSLR camera display.
