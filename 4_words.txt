People 
Folks
Actors
Volunteers
Chosen ones
Audience members


tasks[]
Tell you something about themselves
Be empty and visible
Lead you somewhere new
Devastate you in new ways
Love each other for us to see
Expose themselves decently and indecently
Complete the ritual and finalize the prophecy
Let me speak through them 


Without the help of people2[] ,  the people[] will not tasks[] .


people2[]
You
Audience members

More educated species

The gods 
Their ancestors
Rulers from the past
Actors


If you cannot tasks2[] , the people[] consequences[] .


tasks2[] 
Discover something new
Believe the truth of this space
Find a solution to the problem’s we’ve been having
Leave the auditorium
Stay here forever
Stop thinking 
Help me complete the circle
Come together despite your differences to watch nothing happen 


consequences[] 
Have to leave forever
Are no more than people2[]
Will become subject to their own thoughts
Will have to explain this work to you
Become your official authority figures, perhaps even your fathers
Are actors, they are just actors
Are audience members, are you, are me
