Performers (four or five) will sit on five chairs arranged the stage in a straight line (not parallel with the stage but no more than 30 degrees off from the angle of the front of the stage) and facing the wall, away from the audience. The chairs will be off center to stage left.


If there are four performers, two will be in underwear, one will be semi-clothed (however they choose to interpret this), and one will be fully clothed. 
If there are five performers, the number in underwear increases to three.


These performers can whisper amongst themselves (and are encouraged to do so), are given water and snacks (popcorn and strawberries, which will be completely cleaned up afterwards if anything is to fall), and are free to get up and leave the experience at any point. 


The performer in the second seat from stage left will silently get up and sit in the reserved seating after the screen turns red momentarily. Next time the screen turns red, the performer farthest to stage right follows, sitting in the reserve seating as well. 


The performers then stay in place until the audience is completely gone, unless the performers decide to leave prematurely, and then they are free to do so.
